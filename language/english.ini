Started in 2017 by Harken USA, Blockheads is a web-based youth sailing fan club. The mission of Blockheads is to equip the next generation with the knowledge and skills to be more confident and self-sufficient so they bond with sailing more deeply.<br>
<br>

<h3>How does my child get involved?</h3>
If they are under 25, youth sailors may join the free program <a href=\"join.php\">here</a>.  New members will receive their Blockheads membership kit in the mail.<br>
<br>

The Blockheads program is expanding to new countries, but may not yet be available in yours. Please check if your country is currently enrolling Blockheads members by looking at the drop-down country selector on the Blockheads Join page.<br>
<br>

To enroll a child under 13, you will need to download and return the <a href=\"pdf/Parental_Consent.pdf\">parental consent form</a>. Instructions for doing this are included on the form.<br>
